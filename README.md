# RiverFuzz

Core fuzzing code is located in `/Fuzz/Program.cs`.

The program has a bunch of hardcoded paths, so it probably won't work if you just install it. If you want to set it up let me know, and I can set up some sort of resources config.

## Dependencies:
 - PosgreSQL 11
 - Visual Studio Community 2019 (Unless on Linux)
 - .NET Core 3.0
